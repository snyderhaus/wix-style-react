# Upgrading `wix-style-react` from v6.0.0 to v7.0.0

## Motivation

The new version was introduced to support React16 development within the library.
Most of the changes in this version are internal to the library, so we are expecting
this to be a smooth and easy upgrade for you to make.
The breaking changes are described below.

## Breaking changes

### React dependency [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-16.8-brightgreen)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react/v/16.8.6)
We are no longer supporting react v15, your application would have to supply react version >= 16.8.0

### The following components are no longer exist

`<RichTextArea/>` `<RichTextAreaComposite/>`

These deprecated components were completely removed in Version 7. You should use the `<RichTextInputArea/>`
and `<FormField/>` components instead.

Refer to the [RichTextArea](RichTextArea.md) migration guide
